This is Interstellar Bot 1973, a bot that simulates the voyage of an exploratory spaceship.
The bot runs in real-time, rolling the chance for an encounter to occur every minute, and
posting a report of what encounters have occurred to Facebook every hour.

Encounters will have various effects on each of the ship's systems and resources, and as time 
progresses the 'story' of the ship will too. While there is no scripted story that is followed, 
notable encounters are recorded and can be accessed via the supplemental Discord Bot, as can a
report on the status of the vessel

Additionally, crew member names can be submitted either via the comments section of a specific
Facebook post, or through moderated Discord submissions. Facebook entries are not moderated as
they are taken directly from the commenter's profile name.
